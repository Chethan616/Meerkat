## 📦 **Package Name Explanation**

### **What Changed (What Matters for Play Store):**

✅ **Android Package ID:** `com.chethan616.meerkat`
- This is what Google Play Store sees
- This is what identifies YOUR app
- This is DIFFERENT from LocalSend's package
- **This is all you need for Play Store!**

### **What Stayed the Same (Internal, Doesn't Matter):**

⚙️ **Flutter Package Name (in pubspec.yaml):** `localsend_app`
- This is just an internal code identifier
- Play Store doesn't see this
- Users never see this
- Keeping it prevents breaking 1000+ import statements

**Why?** Changing it would require editing hundreds of Dart files. The Android package ID is what actually matters for:
- Play Store uniqueness ✅
- User-visible branding ✅
- Legal separation from LocalSend ✅
