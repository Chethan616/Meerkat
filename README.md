# 🦊 Meet Meerkat: Fast, Private File Sharing

Ever tried sending a big video project to your friend sitting right next to you, only to get stuck with slow Wi-Fi or “Internet required” errors?  
**Meerkat** fixes that. 🚀  

It’s a simple app that lets you share files **without an internet connection** — fast, private, and completely offline.

> 🧡 Inspired by the awesome [LocalSend](https://github.com/localsend/localsend) project — we just gave it a fresh look with modern features.  
> Big thanks to the LocalSend team! 👋

## ✨ What Makes Meerkat Cool

- **📡 Go Offline:** Share files over your local Wi-Fi network. No internet needed!  
- **🔒 Keep it Secret:** Files go straight from your device to theirs — no servers, no data collection.  
- **💡 Simple & Clean:** Redesigned with a clean, minimal interface anyone can use.  
- **🎨 Open Source:** Learn from the code, tweak it, or even build your own features.

## 🧠 How Does It Work?

Meerkat (and LocalSend) skips the “upload → server → download” part.  
Instead, it creates a **direct, secure HTTPS connection** between devices on the same Wi-Fi network — meaning faster transfers and complete privacy.
